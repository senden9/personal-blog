## Content
Here I will write irregular posts about software and hardware development.

The programming languages that I use will be [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), Python and C#.
Rust will be compiled either for x86-64, ARM or [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) CPU's.

## What drives this Blog
This blog is a static site compiled via [Zola](https://getzola.org/).
The resulting files are hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). You can find the
source code of this blog in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/senden9/personal-blog).

It is not possible to write comments at the moment.
I will think about possible solutions that integrate well with this static page approach.

If you want to know more about me look at the [about me](./aboutme/_index.md) page.
